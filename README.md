# [Project 1: Predicting Wine Quality: Project Overview](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/DS-Wine-Quality-Project)
* Data Cleaning
* Statistical inference with Multiple Linear Regression to find most important characteristics for explaining wine quality
* Created a Multinomial Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict wine quality based on characteristics
* Used K-Fold cross-validation to reach the best model

# Project 2: Example with Classification or Regression
* XGBoosted Decision Trees?


# Project 3: Example with SQL
* Advanced SQL queries


# Project 4: Deep Learning
* ANN


# Project 5: Clustering
