# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Prediction](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/Data-science-salary-prediction)
## Overview
* Built a machine learning model to predict average salary of data scientists in the US (RMSE ~ $14K), based on data from Glassdoor.
* Engineered features by creating new variables, using one-hot and numerical encoding for categorical variables and more.
* Trained and compared three models: Multiple Linear, Lasso and XGBoosted Decision Tree regressions.
* Optimized hyperparameters with GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Vizualized attributes of the best model (XGBoost), such as feature importance and the decision tree.

# [Project 2: Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/DS-Wine-Quality-Project)
## Overview
* Created a machine learning classification model to to predict wine quality (67% accuracy), based on the wines' chemical characteristics.
* Used statistical analysis (multiple linear OLS regression) to highlight key predictors of quality.
* Built and compared three models: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
* Optimized the models with GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and reach the best model.
