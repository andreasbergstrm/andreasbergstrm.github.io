# Andreas' Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/Data-science-salary-prediction)
* Built a machine learning model to predict average salary of data scientists in the US (RMSE ~ $14K), based on data from Glassdoor.
* Engineered features by creating new variables, using one-hot and numerical encoding for categorical variables and more.
* Trained and compared three models: Multiple Linear, Lasso and XGBoosted Decision Tree regressions.
* Optimized hyperparameters with GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Vizualized attributes of the best model (XGBoost), such as feature importance and the decision tree.

# [Project 2: Wine Quality Classification: Project Overview](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/DS-Wine-Quality-Project)
* Data Cleaning
* Statistical inference with Multiple Linear Regression to find most important characteristics for explaining wine quality
* Created a Multinomial Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict wine quality based on characteristics
* Used K-Fold cross-validation to reach the best model
* Scaled input data to streamline the learning process
