# Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Wine Quality Classification: Project Overview](https://github.com/andreasbergstrm/DS-Wine-Quality-Project)
* Data Cleaning
* Statistical inference with Multiple Linear Regression to find most important characteristics for explaining wine quality
* Created a Multinomial Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict wine quality based on characteristics
* Used K-Fold cross-validation to reach the best model
* Scaled input data to streamline the learning process
